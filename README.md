#print("hello world")
#this piece of code in programming is called stringswhich consist of character.

#print("hello world\nhello world\nhello world")
#print("hello + Aman")
#this is called escape sequence in programming

# print("hello"+ "aman")
# # so now how we can add space in between
# print("hello" + " " + "aman")

# INPUT FUNCTION 
# main function to take input from user
#print("hello " + input("what is your name"))

#write a program that print the number of character in a user name 
#print(len(input("what is your name")))

#VARIABLE IN PYTHON
# name = input("what is your name")
# print(name)  # prints the name of the user

# name = input("what is your name")
# length = len(name)
# print(length)

# WAP that switches the values stored in the variable a and b
# a = 10
# b = 20

# # Swapping
# a, b = b, a

# # Output the result
# print("After swapping:")
# print("a =", a)
# print("b =", b)

# Using a Temporary Variable

# a = 10
# b = 20

# # Swapping using a temporary variable
# temp = a
# a = b
# b = temp

# print("a =", a)
# print("b =", b)

# Using Arithmetic Operations (only for numbers)

# a = 10
# b = 20

# # Swapping using arithmetic
# a = a + b
# b = a - b
# a = a - b

# print("a =", a)
# print("b =", b)

# WELCOME TO THE BAND NAME GENERATOR
# This program generates a random band name based on a list of words

#CREATE A GREETING FOR YOUR PROGRAM
# print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")
# # ASK THE USER FOR THE CITY THEY GREW UP IN 
# city = input("What city did you grow up in?\n")
# # ASK THE USER FOR THE NAME OF A PET
# pet = input("What was the name of your first pet?\n")
# # COMBINE THE NAME OF THEIR CITY AND PET AND SHOW THEM THEIR BAND NAME
